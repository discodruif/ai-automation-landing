    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 24 Feb 2026</p>

    <p>These Terms govern your use of AI Automation Setup services. By requesting or purchasing setup service, you agree to these Terms.</p>

    <h2>Service scope</h2>
    <p>The €99 package includes one agreed automation workflow, configured in your existing tools, plus basic testing and handoff. Any additional workflows, major revisions, or third-party subscription costs are out of scope unless agreed separately.</p>

    <h2>Client responsibilities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide accurate requirements and timely feedback</li>
      <li>Provide required access to relevant tools/accounts</li>
      <li>Ensure lawful use of your own data and systems</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Delivery timeline</h2>
    <p>Standard target delivery is within 48 hours after scope and required access are confirmed. Delays caused by missing access, unclear requirements, or third-party outages may extend timing.</p>

    <h2>Guarantee</h2>
    <p>If we cannot deliver the agreed single workflow within 48 hours after requirements and access are confirmed, you may cancel the order at no charge.</p>

    <h2>Payments and refunds</h2>
    <p>Fees are one-time per scoped workflow. Once delivery and handoff are completed, payments are non-refundable except where required by law or under the guarantee above.</p>

    <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, our liability is limited to the amount paid for the specific service. We are not liable for indirect or consequential losses.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>For questions about these Terms, reply through your existing project email thread.</p>
